# Observer Exercise

* Clone the codebase

* Run ObserverTest.java as a JUnit test (2 tests should pass and 1 should fail)

* Add a new class BinObserver.java that observes the value and stores it in binary format (e.g., 8 in decimal is 1000 in binary)

* Run ObserverTest.java again and get all tests passing
