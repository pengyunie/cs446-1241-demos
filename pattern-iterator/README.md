# Iterator Demo

* Run IteratorTest.java as a JUnit test.

* Comment out the @Ignore in IteratorTest.java and check what happens if we're not using iterator.

* Add a ShuffledDataGenerator which generates data out of a list in random order (without replacement).
  * Add a ShuffledDataIterator for it.
  * Add a test case in IteratorTest.java for it.
